# Cloudflare Stream Integration

This application now automatically uploads recorded videos to Cloudflare Stream for reliable hosting and global delivery.

## Features

- **Automatic Upload**: Videos are automatically uploaded to Cloudflare Stream after recording
- **Upload Progress**: Real-time upload progress tracking
- **Stream Player**: Videos play using Cloudflare's optimized player
- **Share Links**: Get shareable links for your recordings
- **Status Tracking**: See upload and processing status for each video

## Setup

### 1. Cloudflare Account Setup

1. Sign up for [Cloudflare Stream](https://www.cloudflare.com/products/cloudflare-stream/)
2. Get your Account ID from the Cloudflare dashboard
3. Create an API token with Stream:Edit permissions

### 2. Environment Configuration

Add your Cloudflare credentials to the `.env` file:

```env

```

### 3. Installation

npm install
```

## How It Works

1. **Recording**: When you finish recording, the video is saved locally
2. **Auto-Upload**: The server automatically uploads the video to Cloudflare Stream
