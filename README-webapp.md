```
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ index.html          # Main HTML file with Tailwind CSS
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ app.js             # React application component
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ server.js          # Express server with API endpoints
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ uploads/           # Uploaded webcam videos (git-ignored)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ recordings/        # Completed recordings (git-ignored)
```

## Configuration

The application uses these environment variables (optional):
- `PORT`: Server port (default: 3000)
- `RECORDING_DURATION`: Default recording duration in ms
- `BROWSERLESS_TOKEN`: Your Browserless.io token (from .env)

## Troubleshooting

### "Server not starting"
- Check if port 3000 is already in use
- Ensure all dependencies are installed: `npm install`

### "Upload failed"
- Verify the file is MP4 format
- Check file size is under 100MB
- Ensure `uploads/` directory has write permissions

### "Recording failed"
- Verify `.env` file contains valid `BROWSERLESS_TOKEN`
- Check console logs for specific error messages
- Ensure sufficient disk space for recordings

## Development

To modify the UI:
1. Edit `app.js` for React components
2. Tailwind classes can be added directly in JSX
3. Server logic is in `server.js`

The application uses:
- React 18 for UI components
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- Express.js for the backend
- Multer for file uploads
